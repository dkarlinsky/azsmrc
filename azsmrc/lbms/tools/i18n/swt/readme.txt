ETC is a SimpleWidetToolkit (SWT) based java program.  SWT is a toolkit
designed by IBM to help in creating portable pleasing GUIs.  That being
said, you have to have the correct SWT libraries in place for your
particular platform for this application to work.

Downloads for the SWT can be found here:

For example, to get the latest stable version of SWT go here:

http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1.2-200601181600/index.php

For which ever version you choose, scroll down until you see
the title "SWT Binary and Source"

From here, simply download the version that matches your computer.

This file will need to be unzipped in your ETC directory for it to work.
